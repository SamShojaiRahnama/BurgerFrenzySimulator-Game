# **BurgerFeenzy Simulator**

**BurgerFeenzy Simulator** is a dynamic burger order simulation game developed using Java and JavaFX. The game is designed with accessibility in mind and provides a competitive edge through experience points (XP). The project was developed with a strong focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and incorporates multiple design patterns to ensure a maintainable, scalable, and enjoyable game experience.

## **Project Overview**

Our objective was to create a JavaFX-based game that simulates real-world customer interactions and burger order fulfillment. Through this project, we enhanced our understanding of JavaFX, design patterns, and accessibility by introducing features such as audio descriptions for low-vision players.

### **Key Features Include:**

- **Dynamic Customer Behaviors**: Simulating varied emotional states and random order generation to make each game session unique and challenging.
- **Accessibility through Audio Descriptions**: Audio portions for order descriptions and ingredients were added to improve the gaming experience for low-vision players.
- **Competitive Gameplay**: Players accumulate experience points (XP) by fulfilling orders accurately and on time. The scoreboard adds a competitive spirit and contributes to the gameâ€™s win conditions.
- **Design Patterns and Principles**:
  - **Observer**: For event-driven updates between objects.
  - **Strategy**: To dynamically choose different customer behaviors and game strategies.
  - **Composite**: To handle complex objects like orders with various ingredients.
  - **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: For separating business logic from the graphical interface.

## **Features**

- **JavaFX GUI**: A polished user interface that allows players to interact with the game intuitively.
- **Accessibility**: Audio descriptions for the orders and ingredients enhance the game's accessibility for low-vision users.
- **XP-based Scoreboard**: Experience points (XP) are awarded for fulfilling orders quickly and correctly, adding a competitive element to the game.
- **Real-time Customer Interactions**: Customers in the game can display a range of emotions, adding complexity and unpredictability to the gameplay.
- **Dynamic Order Generation**: Orders are randomly generated, keeping players on their toes with unique combinations every session.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Java**: Core programming language for game logic and mechanics.
- **JavaFX**: Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Design Patterns**: Observer, Strategy, Composite, and MVC for clean, scalable, and maintainable code architecture.
- **Audio Integration**: Added audio elements to enhance accessibility features.

## **Getting Started**
